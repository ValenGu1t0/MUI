# Restaurant Menu with React

Interactive restaurant menu that allows performing CRUD operations on an endpoint using HTTP methods and JSON-formatted data. I used React as the main technology, along with Tailwind and Material UI for the UI. The result is a dynamic food menu that enables users to create, modify, and delete different dishes, each with attributes such as stock, rating, image..

I followed the inspiration from a Figma design to create it. While the design was simple, I decided to add a personal touch. You can find the inspirations in the 'FigmaInspo' folder.

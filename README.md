# Restaurant Menu with React

## Tech Description
Interactive restaurant menu that allows performing CRUD operations on an endpoint using HTTP methods and JSON-formatted data. I used React as the main technology, along with Tailwind and Material UI for the UI. The result is a dynamic food menu that enables users to create, modify, and delete different dishes, each with attributes such as stock, rating, image..

## Storage
The dishes and the application state are stored in the following endpoint (https://67b634b907ba6e59084014c8.mockapi.io/food), for which I used mockAPI, and the data is updated with each change in the app. You can interact with the page and see the updates reflected instantly if you'd like!

## Design
I followed the inspiration from a Figma design to create it. While the design was simple, I decided to add a personal touch. You can find the inspirations in the 'FigmaInspo' folder.

## Deploy
To deploy the React app, I used Vercel along with GitHub to deploy directly from the repository. The link is in the description or right here: https://restaurant-menu-react-eight.vercel.app/
